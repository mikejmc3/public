# About SAS Notebooks

I will sometimes use **SAS Notebooks** in this repository. For those who may be unfamiliar with SAS Notebooks, they are used to mix formatted Markdown text with SAS code and results, similar to a Jupyter Notebook.

The catch with SAS Notebooks is that viewing a file saved in *.sasnb format requires the [SAS extension for Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/sassoftware/vscode-sas-extension).

To make things easier for readers who do not have or want VS Code and/or the SAS extension, I will also provide an HTML export of any *.sasnb file I add to this repository. In all such cases, the contents of the original *.sasnb file and its *.html export file will be identical. For the HTML exports, I am using [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/) to render equations properly.
