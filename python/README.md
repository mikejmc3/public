# About Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks in this folder use the *.ipynb extension. Unlike similar SAS- and R notebook file types, Jupyter notebooks generally will display properly when viewing the file on GitHub's website. Alternatively, these files can be downloaded and viewed through standard means, such as Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, Microsoft VS Code, etc.
