# About R Notebooks

I will sometimes use R Notebooks in this repository. For those who may be unfamiliar with R Notebooks, they are used to mix formatted Markdown text with R code and results, similar to a Jupyter Notebook. I will provide the original *.Rmd notebook file as well as the *.html export, which contains the formatted text, code, and results.

For the best experience, viewing the HTML file is recommended.
